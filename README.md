👋 Hi, I’m @KevinTXY

🖱️ I'm an engineer @ Microsoft working on the latest and greatest for Windows, particularly 
on the Input Platform (Mouse, Touch, Pen, etc...) and other exciting user-focused areas. 
As you might expect for an OS developer, my primary expertise today is C/C++.

🚂 I graduated from Purdue in 2020 majoring in Computer Science with a Machine Intelligence Specialization 

👨‍💻 Most of the projects on my GitHub page are personal and unaffiliated with my role. As a former hackathon-enthusiast,
I've worked on a wide variety of technologies building all sorts of ideas, so many of these are collaborative or unfinished works.
